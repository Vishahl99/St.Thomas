            <h1>From The Desk of Director</h1>
        </u>
        <p>
            It is my proud privilege to warmly welcome you into the prospectus of this learning community. The St.
            Thomas School is dedicated to develop skilled students who can pursue their interest and strengths to
            the best of their ability so that our enriched students merge into the society building a strong
            generation for a better world tomorrow through dynamic education.
            <br><br>
            We are committed to work collaberately with parents to nurture an individual who posses love for nation,
            society community & family values. We also expect that we as a family we will encourage the students to
            think critically.
            <br><br>
            We work with the core belief that wisdom can be cultivated gradually amongst all individuals. It is not
            enough to make children literate and academically intelligent what is more important is to make them
            wise so that they are able to use their intelligence judiciously. The school therefore has under taken a
            great leap in integrating information and communication technology into the class room teaching and
            learning process.
            <br><br>
            I would like to end with the words of Albert Einstein imagination is more important than knowledge. For
            while knowledge defines all we currently know and understand imagination points to all we might yet
            discover and create.
            <br><br>
            Thinking critically is the pinnacle of the accumulation of knowledge and experience.
